  - resolutioncode: Length of the time interval expressed in compliance with ISO 8601.
  - offshoreonshore: Indicates whether the wind farm is offshore or onshore.
  - region: Location of the production unit.
  - gridconnectiontype: Indicates whether the production unit is connected to the Elia grid or to a DSO grid.
  - measured: The value running average measured for the reported time interval.
  - monitoredcapacity: Total available production capacity.
  - mostrecentforecast: Most recently forecasted volume.
  - mostrecentconfidence10: Most recently forecasted volume with a probability of less than 10% that a lower volume will be produced.
  - mostrecentconfidence90: Most recently forecasted volume with a probability of less than 10% that a higher volume will be produced.
  - dayahead11hforecast: Day-ahead forecasted volume published at 11AM. 
  - dayahead11hconfidence10: Day-ahead forecasted volume with a probability of less than 10% that a lower volume will be produced, published at 11AM. 
  - dayahead11hconfidence90: Day-ahead forecasted volume with a probability of less than 10% that a higher volume will be produced, published at 11AM.
  - dayaheadforecast: Day-ahead forecasted volume to be produced.
  - dayaheadconfidence10: Day-ahead forecasted volume with a probability of less than 10% that a lower volume will be produced.
  - dayaheadconfidence90: Forecasted volume with a probability of less than 10% that a higher volume will be produced.
  - weekaheadforecast: Week-ahead forecasted volume.
  - weekaheadconfidence10: Week-ahead forecasted volume with a probability of less than 10% that a lower volume will be produced.
  - weekaheadconfidence90: Week-ahead forecasted volume with a probability of less than 10% that a higher volume will be produced.
  - loadfactor: The percentage ratio between measured power generation and the total monitored power capacity.
  - decrementalbidid: Elia has requested the wind park to reduce production below its maximum capacity during this QH. This is defined as the amount of Megawatt for a given quarter-hour (QH).Empty: No decremental bids were requested by Elia, and the wind park is not required to lower its production during this QH..Note: Elia does not publish any information around decremental bids on request of the parks owners themselves.
